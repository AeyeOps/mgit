# MAWEP Framework Additions - Full Paths and Content

## 1. Time Estimation Reality

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/time-estimation.md`

**Content to Add**:
```markdown
### AI Agent Performance Benchmarks (Empirical Data)

Based on production sprint data:

#### Task Duration Reality
| Task Type | Human Estimate | AI Actual | Multiplier |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Simple Module Extraction | 30-45 min | 4-8 min | 0.15x |
| Complex Module Creation | 1-2 hours | 10-15 min | 0.2x |
| Integration Phase | 30 min | 5-10 min | 0.25x |
| Full 4-Issue Sprint | 6-8 hours | 31 min | 0.08x |

#### Sprint Duration Formula
```
Total = Critical_Path + Max(Parallel_Tasks) + Integration + Buffer
Where Buffer = 10% for verification
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: AI agents complete tasks 10-15x faster than human developers would. Plan accordingly!
```

## 2. Reality Check Protocol

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/reality-check-protocol.md`

**Content to Add** (new section after "Common Oversells"):
```markdown
### AI Sprint Execution Reality

**Time Estimation Pitfalls**
- ❌ "This module extraction will take an hour" → ✅ Reality: 5-10 minutes
- ❌ "Integration is complex, allow 2 hours" → ✅ Reality: 10-15 minutes  
- ❌ "Need to wait hours between agent invocations" → ✅ Reality: 30-60 seconds

**Pod Isolation Reality**
- Pods CANNOT see each other's work during execution
- Each pod works in isolated git worktree
- Dependencies must be handled during integration, not execution
- Design modules to be standalone during development

**Integration Complexity**
- Most integrations are straightforward file copies
- Conflicts are rare with proper pre-sprint analysis
- Testing after integration takes < 5 minutes
```

## 3. MAWEP Practical Patterns

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/mawep-practical-patterns.md`

**Content to Add** (after "Pattern: Continuous Invocation Awareness" around line 150):
```markdown
### Pattern: Reality-Based Sprint Planning

**Context**: Traditional estimates assume human development speed.

**Pattern**: 
1. Estimate as if human developer
2. Divide by 10-15 for AI execution time
3. Add 10% buffer for integration/verification
4. Set invocation intervals at 30-60 seconds

**Example**:
- Human estimate: 6 hours for 4 modules
- AI reality: 6 hours ÷ 12 = 30 minutes
- With buffer: 33 minutes total
- Actual Sprint 3A: 31 minutes ✅

### Pattern: Standalone Module Design

**Context**: Pods cannot import from each other during execution.

**Pattern**:
1. Each pod creates self-contained modules
2. Shared interfaces defined minimally upfront
3. Dependencies resolved during integration only
4. No cross-pod imports during development

**Anti-pattern**: Pod-4 trying to import Pod-1's exceptions
**Solution**: Pod-4 creates own base exceptions, reconciled during integration
```

## 4. Orchestrator Prompt

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/prompts/orchestrator-prompt.md`

**Content to Add** (in Stage 5 - Integration section):
```markdown
#### Sprint 3A Integration Protocol

Based on empirical success:

1. **Integration Order** (5-10 minutes total):
   ```
   Foundation modules → Dependent modules → Conflict-prone modules
   ```

2. **Rapid Integration Steps**:
   - Copy files from pod worktrees (1-2 min)
   - Update imports in main (2-3 min)
   - Resolve any conflicts (1-2 min)
   - Verify functionality (1-2 min)

3. **Success Verification**:
   ```bash
   python -m [package] --version  # Basic functionality
   python -m [package] --help     # CLI structure
   python -c "import [new_modules]"  # Import testing
   ```

**Time Box**: If integration exceeds 15 minutes, something is wrong. Stop and analyze.
```

## 5. MAWEP Overview

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/mawep-overview.md`

**Content to Update** (replace existing "When to Use MAWEP" section):
```markdown
### When to Use MAWEP

✅ **Use MAWEP when:**
- Sprint can complete in < 2 hours (remember: AI is 10-15x faster)
- Issues have clear dependency structure  
- Modules can be designed standalone
- Integration complexity is manageable

❌ **Avoid MAWEP when:**
- Heavy inter-module dependencies during development
- Continuous cross-pod communication needed
- Integration would exceed development time
```

## 6. MAWEP Quickstart

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/MAWEP-QUICKSTART.md`

**Content to Add** (at the very top, after the title):
```markdown
> ⚠️ **REALITY CHECK**: AI agents complete tasks 10-15x faster than human estimates. 
> A "day's work" often completes in 30-45 minutes. Don't over-allocate time!
>
> **Quick Reference**:
> - Module extraction: 5-10 min
> - Complex creation: 10-15 min  
> - 4-issue sprint: 30-45 min
> - 8-issue sprint: 60-90 min
```

## 7. Post-Mortem Analyst Prompt

**Full Path**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/prompts/post-mortem-analyst-prompt.md`

**Content to Add** (in the analysis criteria section):
```markdown
### Time Estimation Accuracy

Analyze and report:
1. Original estimate vs actual duration
2. Per-pod execution times with timestamps
3. Parallel execution efficiency
4. Integration phase duration
5. Variance percentage and lessons learned

Template:
```
Phase 1 (Critical): X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance
Phase 2 (Parallel): X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance  
Integration: X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance
Total: X min (Est: Y hours) - Z% variance

Key Learning: [insight about estimation accuracy]
```
```
