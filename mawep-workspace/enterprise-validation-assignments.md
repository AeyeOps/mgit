# Enterprise Validation Sprint Assignments

## Sprint Overview
**Mission**: Validate all enterprise infrastructure components built in the Production Deployment Sprint through end-to-end practical testing.

**Critical Gap**: Infrastructure exists but hasn't been validated to work together in real enterprise scenarios.

**Timeline**: 30 minutes (validation-focused)

## Validation Protocol

### Phase 1: Individual Pod Validation (20 minutes)
Each pod performs their validation independently:
1. Execute test scenarios
2. Document results and issues
3. Capture evidence (logs, screenshots, metrics)
4. Report validation status

### Phase 2: Integration Validation (10 minutes)
Test cross-component interactions:
1. End-to-end enterprise deployment simulation
2. Full stack monitoring verification
3. Security + CI/CD integration testing
4. Performance under load testing

### Success Criteria Matrix

| Component | Validation Required | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Docker | Build + Run + Health | ✓ Containers build, ✓ Health checks respond |
| Monitoring | Metrics + Dashboards | ✓ Data flows, ✓ Alerts trigger |
| Security | Protection + Detection | ✓ Credentials safe, ✓ Threats blocked |
| CI/CD | Automation + Recovery | ✓ Workflows execute, ✓ Rollbacks work |

### Documentation Requirements
Each pod must provide:
- ✅ Test execution log
- ✅ Success/failure evidence
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Issue identification (if any)
- ✅ Remediation recommendations

### Sprint Completion Criteria
- [ ] All 4 validation issues completed
- [ ] End-to-end integration test passed
- [ ] Validation evidence documented
- [ ] Enterprise readiness certification issued

## MAWEP Orchestration Notes

**Agent Task Execution**: Each agent receives specific validation commands and must execute them practically, not theoretically.

**Evidence Collection**: All tests must produce tangible evidence (command outputs, logs, metrics).

**Integration Focus**: This sprint validates that components built separately actually work together.

**Enterprise Confidence**: Goal is 100% confidence in enterprise deployment capability.

**Reality Testing**: Real commands, real outputs, real validation - not documentation review.
