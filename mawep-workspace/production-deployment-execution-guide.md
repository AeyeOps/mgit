# Production Deployment Sprint - Execution Guide

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint**: Production Deployment Sprint  
**Duration**: 35 minutes  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Objective**: Transform mgit into enterprise-deployable solution

## Execution Timeline

### Phase 1: Parallel Pod Execution (0-25 minutes)
Execute Pods 1, 2, and 3 in parallel for maximum efficiency.

### Phase 2: Dependent Pod Execution (15-30 minutes)
Pod 4 starts at 15 minutes (depends on Pod 1 and 2 deliverables).

### Phase 3: Integration (30-35 minutes)
Combine all deliverables into unified deployment solution.

## Pod Activation Commands

### Pod 1: Docker Containerization
```bash
# Activate Pod 1 for Docker containerization
cd /opt/aeo/mgit
# Work in worktree: /opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
```

**Primary Focus**: Create production-ready Docker infrastructure
- Multi-stage Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml for development
- Container security configuration
- GitHub Actions container publishing

### Pod 2: Security Hardening
```bash
# Activate Pod 2 for security hardening
cd /opt/aeo/mgit
# Work in worktree: /opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-2
```

**Primary Focus**: Implement enterprise security patterns
- Secure credential management
- Input validation framework
- Security configuration guidelines
- Vulnerability assessment

### Pod 3: Monitoring & Observability
```bash
# Activate Pod 3 for monitoring/observability
cd /opt/aeo/mgit
# Work in worktree: /opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-3
```

**Primary Focus**: Add enterprise monitoring capabilities
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring

### Pod 4: Deployment Automation
```bash
# Activate Pod 4 for deployment automation (starts at 15 minutes)
cd /opt/aeo/mgit
# Work in worktree: /opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-4
```

**Primary Focus**: Create automated deployment infrastructure
- GitHub Actions release workflow
- Deployment scripts and documentation
- Production deployment checklist

## Key Deliverables

### Immediate Deliverables (by 25 minutes)
- **Pod 1**: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, container workflows
- **Pod 2**: Security modules, validation framework, security docs
- **Pod 3**: Monitoring modules, logging framework, health endpoints

### Final Deliverables (by 35 minutes)
- **Pod 4**: Release workflows, deployment scripts, automation
- **Integration**: Unified deployment solution
- **Documentation**: Complete deployment guides
