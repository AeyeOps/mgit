# Production Deployment Sprint - Pod Assignments

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint**: Production Deployment Sprint  
**Duration**: 35 minutes  
**Focus**: Enterprise deployment readiness  
**Objective**: Transform mgit from development tool to enterprise-deployable solution

## Business Context
mgit is functionally complete with working test infrastructure, but lacks enterprise production deployment capabilities. This sprint addresses critical deployment infrastructure gaps that prevent enterprise adoption.

## Pod Assignments

### Pod 1: Docker Containerization
**Issue**: #1401 - Docker containerization and deployment  
**Assignment**: Create production-ready containerization infrastructure

- Security headers and configuration
- Audit logging for security events
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Files to Create**:
- `mgit/security/validators.py`
- `mgit/security/credentials.py`
- `docs/security/security-guide.md`

- Security configuration templates

### Pod 3: Monitoring & Observability
**Issue**: #1403 - Monitoring and observability  
**Assignment**: Add enterprise monitoring capabilities  
**Worktree**: `/opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-3`

**Primary Deliverables**:
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring instrumentation

**Technical Requirements**:
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Structured JSON logging
- Request tracing and correlation
- Prometheus metrics export
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)
- Performance monitoring for Git operations

**Files to Create**:
- `mgit/monitoring/metrics.py`
- `mgit/monitoring/logging.py`
- `mgit/monitoring/health.py`
- `docs/operations/monitoring-guide.md`
- Prometheus configuration examples

### Pod 4: Deployment Automation
**Issue**: #1404 - Deployment automation  
**Assignment**: Create automated deployment infrastructure  
**Worktree**: `/opt/aeo/mgit/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-4`

**Primary Deliverables**:
- GitHub Actions release workflow
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Deployment scripts and documentation
- Production deployment checklist

**Technical Requirements**:
- Automated release pipeline
- Multi-environment deployment support
- Rollback and recovery procedures
- Release notes automation
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- Deployment validation and smoke tests

**Files to Create**:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `scripts/deploy.sh`
- `scripts/rollback.sh`
- `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

## Dependencies
- **Pod 4** depends on **Pod 1** (Docker) and **Pod 2** (Security) for deployment automation
- **Pods 1, 2, 3** can work in parallel
- Integration phase will combine all deliverables

## Integration Strategy
1. **Container Integration**: Combine Docker configuration with security hardening
2. **Monitoring Integration**: Add observability to containerized deployment
3. **Automation Integration**: Integrate all components into deployment pipeline
4. **Documentation Integration**: Create unified deployment documentation

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Docker containers build and deploy successfully
- ✅ Security hardening passes enterprise security review
- ✅ Monitoring provides operational visibility
- ✅ Deployment automation enables reliable releases
- ✅ Complete production deployment documentation

## Timeline
**Total Duration**: 35 minutes
- **Parallel Execution**: Pods 1-3 (25 minutes)
- **Pod 4 Execution**: Depends on Pods 1-2 (15 minutes, parallel with Pod 3)
- **Integration Phase**: 5 minutes
- **Testing & Validation**: 5 minutes

## Enterprise Impact
This sprint transforms mgit from a development tool into an enterprise-ready solution with:
- Container-based deployment for Kubernetes/Docker environments
- Enterprise security compliance and audit readiness
- Operational monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Automated deployment with zero-touch releases
- Complete operational documentation and procedures
