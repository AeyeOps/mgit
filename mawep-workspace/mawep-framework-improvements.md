# MAWEP Framework Improvements from Sprint 3A Experience

Based on the Sprint 3A execution (31 minutes total!), here are improvements for the global MAWEP framework:

## 1. Time Estimation Guidelines for AI Agents

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/time-estimation.md`

```markdown
### AI Agent Time Estimation Guidelines

Based on empirical data from production sprints:

#### Task Duration Estimates
- **Simple Module Extraction**: 4-8 minutes per module
  - Moving existing code to new files
  - Updating imports
  - Basic testing
  
- **Complex Module Creation**: 10-15 minutes per module
  - Creating new architecture (ABCs, interfaces)
  - Implementing multiple classes
  - Comprehensive documentation
  
- **Integration Phase**: 5-10 minutes for 4-5 modules
  - Copying files from worktrees
  - Resolving conflicts
  - Verification testing

#### Sprint Duration Formula
```
Total Duration = Critical Path + Max(Parallel Tasks) + Integration
```

Example: Sprint with 1 critical (15 min) + 3 parallel (max 10 min) + integration (5 min) = 30 minutes

⚠️ **WARNING**: Human estimates often 10-15x higher than AI actual performance
```

## 2. Pod Isolation Reality Check

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/patterns/pod-isolation.md`

```markdown
### Pod Isolation Patterns

#### The Reality of Pod Isolation
Pods work in completely isolated git worktrees and **cannot see each other's work** during execution.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Pod needs another pod's interface definitions
```yaml
Problem: Pod-4 needs Pod-1's exception classes
Reality: Pod-4 cannot import from Pod-1's worktree

Solutions:
1. Standalone Implementation: Each pod creates what it needs
2. Shared Base Branch: Merge critical interfaces early
3. Coordination Protocol: Define minimal shared interfaces upfront
```

**Best Practice**: Design modules to be standalone during development, integrate dependencies during merge.
```

## 3. Integration Phase Protocols

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/prompts/orchestrator-prompt.md`

Add to Stage 5 (Integration) section:

```markdown
#### Integration Order Protocol

When integrating multiple pod work:

1. **Analyze Dependencies**: Determine which modules others depend on
2. **Integration Order**: 
   ```
   Foundation modules → Dependent modules → High-conflict modules
   ```
3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   - Copy foundation modules first (usually no conflicts)
   - Apply dependent modules with import updates
   - Handle high-conflict files last with careful merging

**Example from Sprint 3A**:
1. Provider interfaces (foundation, no conflicts)
2. Git operations (updates __main__.py imports)
3. Async executor (standalone utility)
4. Error handling (potential conflicts with provider exceptions)
```

## 4. Granular Timestamp Tracking

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/state-tracking.md`

```yaml
# Enhanced MAWEP State Structure
pods:
  pod-1:
    status: complete
    current_issue: 7
    worktree_path: ./worktrees/pod-1
    # NEW: Granular time tracking
    start_time: "2025-05-28T13:00:00-04:00"
    end_time: "2025-05-28T13:15:00-04:00"
    duration_minutes: 15
    last_agent_invocation: "2025-05-28T13:15:00-04:00"

# Sprint-level time tracking
current_sprint: "3A"
sprint_start_time: "2025-05-28T13:00:00-04:00"
sprint_end_time: "2025-05-28T13:31:00-04:00"
sprint_duration_minutes: 31
phase_durations:
  critical_path: 15
  parallel_execution: 9.5
  integration: 5.5
```

## 5. Post-Mortem Template Enhancement

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/framework/templates/postmortem-template.md`

```markdown
## Execution Metrics (with precise timestamps)
- **Phase 1 - Critical Path**:
  - Start: [timestamp]
  - End: [timestamp]
  - Duration: [minutes]
  - Pods: [list]

- **Phase 2 - Parallel Execution**:
  - Start: [timestamp]
  - Pod completion times:
    - Pod-X: [end time] (Duration: [minutes])
  - Phase Total: [max duration in parallel]

- **Integration Phase**:
  - Start: [timestamp]
  - End: [timestamp]
  - Duration: [minutes]

- **Total Sprint Duration**: [total] ([start] - [end] timezone)

### AI Performance vs Human Estimates
- Estimated: [original estimate]
- Actual: [actual duration]
- Variance: [percentage over/under]
- Lesson: [key insight about estimation]
```

## 6. Reality Check Additions

**File**: `~/.claude/reality-check-protocol.md`

Add new section:

```markdown
### AI Agent Performance Reality

**⚠️ CRITICAL: AI agents complete tasks 10-15x faster than human estimates**

Common misconceptions:
- ❌ "Module extraction takes hours" → ✅ Actually 4-15 minutes
- ❌ "Integration is complex and slow" → ✅ Actually 5-10 minutes
- ❌ "Need hours between agent invocations" → ✅ 30-60 seconds is sufficient

**Realistic Sprint Durations**:
- Small sprint (3-4 issues): 20-40 minutes
- Medium sprint (5-8 issues): 45-90 minutes  
- Large sprint (9-12 issues): 2-3 hours

Plan accordingly and don't over-allocate time!
```

## 7. MAWEP Quick Reference Card

**File**: `~/.claude/docs/prompt-packs/mawep/quick-reference.md`

```markdown
# MAWEP Sprint Execution Cheat Sheet

## Time Estimates (Actual AI Performance)
- Simple extraction: 4-8 min
- Complex creation: 10-15 min
- Integration: 5-10 min
- Full sprint (4 issues): 30-45 min

## Execution Pattern
```
Phase 1: Critical Path → Phase 2: Parallel → Integration
    15 min                   10 min            5 min
                          Total: 30 minutes
```

## Pod Commands
```bash
# Check sprint status
cat mawep-workspace/mawep-state.yaml

# Monitor pod progress
ls mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-*/mgit/

# Quick integration check
python -m mgit --version
```

## Common Issues
1. Pods can't see each other's work → Design standalone
2. Integration conflicts → Copy in dependency order
3. Time overestimation → Use AI benchmarks, not human
```

These improvements capture the key learnings from Sprint 3A's incredibly fast execution and provide practical guidance for future MAWEP orchestrations.
