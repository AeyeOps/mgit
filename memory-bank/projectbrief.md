# Project Brief

## Core Requirements & Goals

*   **Objective:** To provide a unified and efficient command-line interface (`mgit`) for managing Git repositories across multiple providers (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Unified CLI for multi-provider repository management.
    *   Bulk operations like `clone-all` and `pull-all` across an entire organization or project.
    *   Named provider configurations with secure credential storage.
    *   Auto-detection of providers from repository URLs.
    *   Asynchronous operations for high performance.
    *   Configuration management for providers and global settings.
    *   Comprehensive application monitoring via the `mgit monitoring` subcommand, including a standalone server, health checks, and performance metrics.
    *   Advanced, user-friendly progress display for long-running operations.
    *   Robust security model with credential masking, validation, and event monitoring.
*   **Target Users:** Developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who work with numerous repositories spread across different Git hosting services.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   Reduced time and effort spent on managing multi-repository, multi-provider workflows.
    *   Increased consistency in development environment setup.
    *   Adoption as a standard tool for teams working with microservices or many-repo architectures.

## Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Core repository operations: cloning, pulling.
    *   Provider support: Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket.
    *   Authentication: PAT, App Passwords.
    *   Configuration: YAML-based configuration for providers.
    *   Platform: Cross-platform support (builds for Linux & Windows).
    *   Observability: A suite of `monitoring` commands for health, metrics, and performance.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Complex Git operations beyond cloning and pulling (e.g., interactive rebase, complex branching strategies).
    *   UI/GUI interface. This is a CLI-first tool.
    *   Direct management of provider resources beyond repositories (e.g., creating projects, managing users).

## Project Vision

The long-term vision for `mgit` is to become an indispensable tool for any developer working in a multi-repository environment. It should abstract away the complexities of individual Git providers, offering a seamless and powerful interface that feels like a natural extension of Git itself. Future development could include deeper integration with provider APIs, support for more Git operations, and a robust plugin system for community-contributed providers.
