# Progress: Azure DevOps CLI Tool (ado-cli) - Initialization

## Current Status

-   The project exists with a core set of features implemented in `ado-cli.py`.
-   Documentation (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) provides a good overview of functionality and design.
-   The Memory Bank has been initialized.
-   UI/UX enhancements implemented: Added detailed progress display for `clone-all`/`pull-all` showing individual repo status, and added interactive confirmation prompts for `clone-all --force` and `login --store`.
-   Fixed a Mypy type hint error.
-   Built a standalone executable using `pyinstaller` (now using `ado-cli.spec` for configuration).
-   Installed the executable to `/opt/bin/ado-cli`.

## What Works (Based on Code Review & Recent Changes)

-   **CLI Structure:** Commands (`clone-all`, `pull-all`, `login`, `config`, `generate-env`, `--version`) are defined using Typer.
-   **Configuration:** Hierarchical loading from environment variables, global config (`~/.config/ado-cli/config`), and defaults seems functional.
-   **Authentication:** PAT-based authentication via the Azure DevOps SDK is implemented. The `login` command allows testing and optionally storing credentials.
-   **Logging:** Setup with `rich` for console and `RotatingFileHandler` for files, including PAT sanitization, is in place.
-   **`clone-all` Command:**
    -   Fetches repositories using the SDK.
    -   Uses `asyncio` and `GitManager` to perform concurrent clones.
    -   Supports `skip`, `pull`, `force` update modes for existing directories.
    -   Handles disabled repositories.
    -   Embeds PAT in clone URLs.
    -   Sanitizes repository names for directory creation.
    -   Includes enhanced progress bar via `rich` showing overall progress and individual repo status.
    -   Includes confirmation prompt via `rich.prompt` before removing existing directories in `force` mode.
-   **`pull-all` Command:**
    -   Identifies local repositories corresponding to the project's repositories (using sanitized names).
    -   Uses `asyncio` and `GitManager` to perform concurrent pulls.
    -   Includes enhanced progress bar via `rich` showing overall progress and individual repo status.
-   **`login` Command:** Includes confirmation prompt via `rich.prompt` before overwriting existing stored credentials when using `--store`.
-   **`config` Command:** Allows viewing and setting global defaults (org URL, concurrency, update mode).
-   **`generate-env` Command:** Creates a `.env.sample` file.
-   **Standalone Executable:** Built successfully using `pyinstaller ado-cli.spec` (which includes hidden imports for `azure-devops` SDK) and installed to `/opt/bin/ado-cli`.

## What's Left to Build / Improve (Based on ARCHITECTURE.md & Review)

-   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement more specific custom exceptions and potentially recovery mechanisms.
-   **Configuration Profiles:** Add support for managing multiple configuration sets (e.g., for different orgs or users).
-   **Testing Suite:** No automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) currently exist. `pytest` is mentioned as a potential tool.
-   **UI Enhancements:** Implemented confirmation prompts and detailed progress display. Further refinements could be explored.
-   **Async Optimizations:** Potential task queue implementation for finer control over concurrency.
-   **Refinement of Existing Commands:** Further testing (especially of the new UI elements) and potential edge case handling for `clone-all` and `pull-all`.

## Known Issues (Initial Assessment)

-   None explicitly identified yet, but lack of automated tests means potential undiscovered bugs.
-   Error handling relies mostly on catching broad exceptions or `subprocess.CalledProcessError`.

## Project Evolution & Decisions (Initial)

-   The project was initiated to solve the problem of bulk repository management in Azure DevOps.
-   Key decisions involved using Python, the official Azure DevOps SDK, Typer, Rich, and Asyncio.
-   The architecture separates concerns into manager classes.
