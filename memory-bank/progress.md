# Project Progress

## Current Status (as of 2025-06-08)

*   **Overall:** The project is in a Beta stage, with a well-defined architecture and a core set of features for managing multi-provider Git repositories. The codebase is structured, typed, and includes a suite of tests and a comprehensive security and monitoring framework.
*   **Current Focus:** The immediate focus has been on establishing a reliable and accurate knowledge base for the project by populating the Memory Bank based on a meticulous code review. This task is now complete.

## What Works

*   **Core Functionality:** The `clone-all`, `pull-all`, `list`, `login`, and `config` commands are implemented.
*   **Provider Architecture:** The Factory and Strategy patterns are in place, allowing for extensible provider support.
    *   The Azure DevOps and GitHub providers are mature and feature-complete.
    *   The Bitbucket provider is functional for core operations.
*   **Security & Monitoring:** The application includes advanced, non-trivial subsystems for security (credential masking, validation, event monitoring) and observability (`monitoring` subcommand).
*   **Development Workflow:** A complete development workflow is defined using `Poetry` and `Poe the Poet`.

## What's Left to Build / Fix

*   **Short-term:**
    *   **Complete Bitbucket Provider:** Bring the `BitbucketProvider` to feature parity with the others by implementing the following methods:
        *   `get_rate_limit_info()`
        *   `get_workspace_permissions()`
        *   `list_repository_branches()`
    *   **Enhance Error Handling:** Improve handling for specific API errors, such as rate limiting, across all providers.
    *   **Expand Test Suite:** Increase code coverage, particularly for the provider and security modules.
*   **Long-term:**
    *   Explore adding more complex Git operations (e.g., `status`, `push`, `branch`).
    *   Develop a more robust plugin system for community-contributed providers.
    *   Improve end-user documentation.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   The `BitbucketProvider` implementation is incomplete, as noted above. This is the most significant known issue.

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **2025-06-08:** A comprehensive, "line-by-line" review of the codebase was performed to populate the Memory Bank. This established a definitive source of truth for the project's architecture, technical stack, and design patterns. This review uncovered major, previously undocumented features like the security and monitoring subsystems, and clarified the implementation status of each Git provider.
