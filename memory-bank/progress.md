# Project Progress

## Current Status (as of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)

*   **Overall:** [User to provide a brief summary, e.g., "Alpha stage, core features implemented, undergoing CI stabilization"].
*   **Current Sprint/Focus:** Resolving CI build failures related to code formatting (Black) and unit tests (Pytest).

## What Works

*   [User to list features or components that are confirmed to be working correctly].
    *   Example:
        *   Basic CLI command structure with Typer.
        *   Configuration loading from `config.yaml` (though `yaml_manager.py` needs formatting).
        *   Provider factory for instantiating provider objects.
        *   Parts of the GitHub provider functionality.
        *   Credential masking in `security/credentials.py` (needs formatting).

## What's Left to Build / Fix

*   **Immediate:**
    *   Fix Black formatting issues in:
        *   `mgit/__init__.py`
        *   `mgit/security/credentials.py`
        *   `mgit/config/yaml_manager.py`
        *   `mgit/__main__.py`
    *   Identify and fix failing unit tests. The `pytest` output needs to be analyzed for specifics.
*   **Short-term:**
    *   [User to list upcoming features or fixes after CI is stable].
*   **Long-term:**
    *   [User to list broader goals or features from the project brief].

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   **CI Failures (Current Focus):**
    *   **Black Formatting:** 4 files require reformatting.
    *   **Pytest Unit Tests:** At least one test suite (`Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, 3.9)`) is failing due to `Run unit tests` step. Specifics pending detailed log review.
*   [User to list any other known bugs or issues with their current status, e.g., "Bitbucket provider authentication occasionally fails under X condition (Investigating)"].

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **YYYY-MM-DD:** Initial project setup. CI pipeline established.
*   **YYYY-MM-DD (Current):** Encountered CI failures due to formatting and test issues. This highlights the importance of running linters/formatters and tests locally before pushing.
*   [User to add significant decisions, changes in direction, or key learnings over time. This section acts as a historical log of project evolution].
