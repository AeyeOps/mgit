# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

*   **Task:** Resolve CI build failures.
    *   **Issue 1:** Code formatting errors reported by Black.
        *   Files affected: `mgit/__init__.py`, `mgit/security/credentials.py`, `mgit/config/yaml_manager.py`, `mgit/__main__.py`.
    *   **Issue 2:** Unit test failures.
        *   The specific test failures need to be identified from the `pytest` output.

## Recent Changes (if any related to current focus)

*   [User to detail any recent changes that might be relevant to the CI failures, if known. Otherwise, "None directly identified yet."].

## Next Steps (Initial Plan)

1.  **Address Formatting Issues:**
    *   Run `python -m black .` to automatically reformat the identified files.
    *   Verify changes and commit.
2.  **Investigate Test Failures:**
    *   Examine the detailed output from `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` to understand which tests are failing and why.
    *   Analyze the failing test code and the corresponding application code.
    *   Implement fixes for the failing tests.
    *   Verify fixes by re-running tests.
    *   Commit changes.
3.  **Verify CI Pipeline:**
    *   Push changes to trigger the CI pipeline.
    *   Confirm that all checks pass.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Prioritize fixing formatting issues first as they are straightforward.
*   Thoroughly analyze test failures before attempting fixes to avoid introducing new issues.
*   Ensure all changes are documented in `progress.md` once resolved.

## Important Patterns & Preferences (Learned during this task)

*   The project uses `black` for code formatting.
*   The project uses `pytest` for testing.
*   CI pipeline includes checks for formatting and tests.

## Learnings & Project Insights (Gained during this task)

*   [To be filled as insights are gained, e.g., "Identified common cause for test failures," "Noted a recurring pattern in formatting inconsistencies"].
