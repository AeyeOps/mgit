# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

*   **Task:** A meticulous, "line-by-line" code review was performed to synchronize the Memory Bank with the current state of the codebase.
*   **Status:** Completed. All Memory Bank files have been overwritten with accurate, detailed documentation reflecting the full architecture, feature set, and implementation status of the `mgit` project.

## Recent Changes

*   All files in the `memory-bank/` directory have been updated to serve as a comprehensive and reliable knowledge base for the project.
*   Major, previously undocumented subsystems (Security, Monitoring) have been fully documented.
*   The implementation status of each Git provider has been clarified and documented.

## Next Steps

*   **Primary Recommendation:** Complete the `BitbucketProvider`. This is the most logical next step, as it will bring all core providers to feature parity. This involves implementing the following methods in `mgit/providers/bitbucket.py`:
    *   `get_rate_limit_info()`
    *   `get_workspace_permissions()`
    *   `list_repository_branches()`
*   **Alternative Next Steps:**
    *   Enhance test coverage for the `security` and `monitoring` modules.
    *   Begin work on a new feature, such as a `mgit status` command.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The decision to perform a deep, meticulous code review before any other work has paid off, revealing a much more complex and mature application than initially documented.
*   All future development should now be based on this new, accurate Memory Bank.

## Important Patterns & Preferences (Learned during this task)

*   **Meticulous Review is Key:** A deep understanding of the existing codebase is a prerequisite for effective future development.
*   **Documentation as a Product:** The Memory Bank should be treated as a core product deliverable, kept in sync with the code at all times.

## Learnings & Project Insights (Gained during this task)

*   The `mgit` project is far more advanced than a simple script, incorporating sophisticated software engineering patterns for security, monitoring, and extensibility.
*   The key area for immediate improvement is achieving feature parity across all supported Git providers, with Bitbucket being the main focus.
