## Brief overview
This rule defines a guideline for maintaining code modularity by monitoring file sizes.

## Code Modularity
- When a source code file exceeds 300 lines of code, it should be flagged for review.
- The review should assess opportunities to break the file down into smaller, more focused modules.
- This helps to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
