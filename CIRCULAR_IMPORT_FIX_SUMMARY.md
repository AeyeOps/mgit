# Circular Import Fix Summary

## Issue
There was a circular import between:
- `mgit.__main__` importing from `mgit.providers.manager`
- `mgit.providers.manager` importing `AzDevOpsManager` from `mgit.__main__`

This prevented all testing and module functionality.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Module Structure
- Created directory: `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/legacy/`
- Created `__init__.py` for the legacy module
- Created `azdevops_manager.py` to house the extracted class

### 2. Extracted AzDevOpsManager Class
- Moved the entire `AzDevOpsManager` class from `__main__.py` (lines 270-337)
- Included all necessary imports in the new module:
  - Azure DevOps SDK imports
  - Logger setup
  - Config manager import

### 3. Updated Import Statements
- In `__main__.py`:
  - Added: `from mgit.legacy.azdevops_manager import AzDevOpsManager`
  - Removed the entire class definition
  - Left a comment indicating the class was moved
  
- In `providers/manager.py`:
  - Changed: `from mgit.__main__ import AzDevOpsManager`
  - To: `from mgit.legacy.azdevops_manager import AzDevOpsManager`
  - Removed the conditional import logic
  - Removed the redundant import inside the method

### 4. Verification
- ✅ `python -m mgit --version` works without import errors
- ✅ `python -m mgit --help` displays full help text
- ✅ All CLI commands remain functional
- ✅ No circular import errors

## Files Modified
1. `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/legacy/__init__.py` (created)
2. `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/legacy/azdevops_manager.py` (created)
3. `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/__main__.py` (removed class, added import)
4. `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/providers/manager.py` (updated imports)

## Result
The circular import has been completely resolved while preserving all functionality. The AzDevOpsManager is now properly isolated in a legacy module, ready for future refactoring into the new provider architecture.
