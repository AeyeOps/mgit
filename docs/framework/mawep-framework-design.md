# Multi-Agent Workflow Execution Process (MAWEP) Framework

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Workflow Execution Process (MAWEP) is a comprehensive framework designed to orchestrate parallel development efforts by multiple AI agents while mitigating isolation risks, dependency conflicts, and coordination challenges. This framework enables 2-10 agents to work concurrently on GitHub issues while maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Issue Analysis and Dependency Management

#### Issue Analyzer Component
```yaml
issue_requirements:
  scope:
    - Well-defined acceptance criteria
    - Estimated complexity (story points or t-shirt sizes)
    - Clear deliverables
  metadata:
    - Dependencies: [issue-123, issue-456]  # Explicit dependencies
    - Labels: [feature, backend, api]
    - Priority: P1-P4
    - Estimated_hours: 8-40
```

#### Dependency Graph Builder
Constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from:
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Listed in issue metadata
- **Implicit Dependencies**: Detected through code analysis
- **Resource Dependencies**: Shared files, modules, or services

```python
class DependencyGraph:
    def analyze_issue(self, issue_id: str) -> Dict:
        """
        Returns:
        {
            'blocks': [issue_ids],     # This issue blocks these
            'blocked_by': [issue_ids], # This issue is blocked by these
            'shared_files': [paths],   # Files multiple issues touch
            'can_parallelize': bool    # Safe to run concurrently
        }
        """
```

### 2. Agent Orchestration and Worktree Management

#### Worktree Structure
```
project-root/
├── .git/
├── worktrees/
│   ├── agent-1-issue-123/
│   ├── agent-2-issue-456/
│   ├── agent-3-issue-789/
│   └── agent-coordinator/
└── src/
```

#### Agent Assignment Algorithm
```python
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def assign_issues(self, available_agents: List[Agent], issue_queue: Queue):
        # 1. Sort issues by priority and dependencies
        # 2. Assign independent issues first
        # 3. Create worktrees for each agent
        # 4. Monitor for completion and reassign
        
        for agent in available_agents:
            issue = self.get_next_available_issue(issue_queue)
            if issue and self.can_assign(agent, issue):
                worktree_path = f"worktrees/agent-{agent.id}-issue-{issue.id}"
                self.create_worktree(worktree_path, issue.branch_name)
                agent.assign(issue, worktree_path)
```

### 3. Communication and Coordination

#### Message Bus Architecture
```yaml
channels:
  broadcast:
    - breaking_changes    # Notify all agents of API/interface changes
    - dependency_updates  # Library or module updates
    - merge_conflicts    # Potential conflict warnings
    
  direct:
    - agent_to_agent     # Peer communication
    - coordinator_commands # Orchestrator directives
    
  status:
    - progress_updates   # Regular heartbeats
    - blockers          # Issues preventing progress
```

#### Message Protocol
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "from_agent": "agent-1",
  "to": ["broadcast:breaking_changes"],
  "message_type": "interface_change",
  "payload": {
    "file": "src/api/base_controller.py",
    "change_type": "method_signature",
    "details": "Added required parameter 'context' to handle_request()",
    "migration_guide": "Update all subclasses to include context parameter",
    "affected_issues": ["124", "125", "128"]
  },
  "priority": "high",
  "requires_ack": true
}
```

### 4. Branching Strategy and Git Workflow

#### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/<issue-number>-<brief-description>
defect/<issue-number>-<brief-description>
hotfix/<issue-number>-<brief-description>
```

#### Workflow Rules
1. **Branch Creation**: Automatically created from main/develop
2. **Rebase Strategy**: Agents must rebase when notified of upstream changes
3. **Commit Standards**: Conventional commits with issue references
4. **Push Frequency**: Every significant milestone (configurable)

```bash
# Agent workflow example
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-1-issue-123 -b feature/123-add-auth-api
cd ../worktrees/agent-1-issue-123
# Work on implementation
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT validation (#123)"
git push origin feature/123-add-auth-api
```

### 5. Progress Monitoring and GitHub Integration

#### Update Frequency Definition
```yaml
update_triggers:
  time_based:
    - every_2_hours      # Minimum update frequency
    - end_of_workday    # Daily summary
    
  event_based:
    - milestone_complete # Feature implemented
    - blocker_encountered # Need help
    - pr_ready          # Ready for review
    - dependency_change # Upstream changes
```

#### Ticket Update Template
```markdown

```

### 6. Conflict Resolution and Coordination Protocols

#### Proactive Conflict Prevention
```python
class ConflictPredictor:
    def analyze_changes(self, agent_changes: Dict[str, List[FileChange]]):
        """
        Predicts potential conflicts before they occur
        """
        conflict_matrix = {}
        
        for agent_id, changes in agent_changes.items():
            for other_agent, other_changes in agent_changes.items():
                if agent_id != other_agent:
                    overlap = self.find_file_overlaps(changes, other_changes)
                    if overlap:
                        conflict_matrix[(agent_id, other_agent)] = {
                            'files': overlap,
                            'severity': self.calculate_severity(overlap),
                            'suggested_action': self.recommend_action(overlap)
                        }
        
        return conflict_matrix
```

#### Coordination Protocols
1. **Lock-Free Coordination**: Use optimistic concurrency with conflict detection
2. **File-Level Notifications**: Alert agents when shared files are modified
3. **Semantic Merge Tools**: AI-assisted merge conflict resolution
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback for breaking changes

### 7. Review and Merge Process

#### Senior Architect Review Workflow
```yaml
review_process:
  pr_creation:
    - Auto-generated from completed issues
    - Includes implementation summary
    - Links to all related issues
    
  review_criteria:
    - Code quality and standards compliance
    - Test coverage (minimum 80%)
    - Documentation completeness
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Security scan results
    
  conflict_resolution:
    - Automated merge attempt
    - Manual resolution if needed
    - Semantic conflict detection
    
  post_merge:
    - Create follow-up issues for:
      - Technical debt
      - Performance optimizations
      - Additional test scenarios
    - Update documentation
    - Notify affected agents
```
