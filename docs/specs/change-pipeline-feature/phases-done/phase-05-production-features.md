- [x] Validation catches data integrity issues with <1% false positives
- [x] Error recovery successfully handles >90% of common failure scenarios
- [x] Performance monitoring provides actionable insights into pipeline bottlenecks
- [x] Production features integrate seamlessly with existing commands
- [x] Compression/decompression maintains data integrity with 100% accuracy
- [x] Validation supports configurable strictness levels
- [x] Recovery mechanisms provide graceful degradation under failures
- [x] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage for production modules

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Remove production command options from `__main__.py` (--enable-compression, --validation-level, etc.)
2. Revert changes to existing commands (remove production feature integration)
3. Delete entire `mgit/pipeline/` directory and package
4. Revert changes to `mgit/changesets/storage.py` (remove compression/validation)
5. Revert changes to `mgit/monitoring/monitor.py` (remove pipeline metrics)
6. Run `poetry run pytest` to ensure no regressions
7. Test that core functionality works without production features
8. Clean up any production-specific changeset collections or compressed data
