# Phase 4: Enable Multi-Provider Support in Pull-All - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully applied the same multi-provider pattern matching fix to the `pull-all` command, ensuring consistent behavior across all bulk operations and eliminating the second instance of the pattern matching bug.

## Effort Estimate
1 hour

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Pattern matching logic extracted ✓
- Phase 2: Multi-provider resolution logic extracted ✓
- Phase 3: Multi-provider support enabled in clone-all ✓

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `mgit/__main__.py` - Updated pull-all command to use same multi-provider logic as clone-all

### Key Changes

#### 1. Fixed Pull-All Multi-Provider Detection

Applied the identical fix from clone-all to pull-all:

**Before (Broken Logic in pull-all):**
```python
# Same broken logic as clone-all had
is_multi_provider_pattern = (
    config is None and url is None and 
    ("*" in first_segment or "?" in first_segment)
)
```

**After (Fixed Logic in pull-all):**
```python
# Use the same extracted pattern matching logic as clone-all
from mgit.utils.pattern_matching import analyze_pattern
from mgit.utils.multi_provider_resolver import resolve_repositories_multi_provider

pattern_analysis = analyze_pattern(project, config, url)

if pattern_analysis.is_multi_provider:
    # FIXED: Multi-provider search for ANY wildcard pattern without explicit provider
    result = asyncio.run(resolve_repositories_multi_provider(
        pattern=pattern_analysis.normalized_pattern,
        explicit_provider=None,  # Search all providers
        explicit_url=None,
        limit=None,
    ))
```

#### 2. Consistent Command Help Text

Updated pull-all command docstring to match clone-all:

```python
"""
Pull updates for all repositories matching a pattern or in a project.

PROJECT can be:
- Exact match: myorg/myproject/myrepo
- Wildcard patterns: myorg/*/myrepo, */myproject/*, myorg/*/*
- Cross-provider: */*/* (searches ALL providers)

IMPORTANT: When no --config is specified, ALL wildcard patterns search 
across ALL configured providers. To limit to a specific provider, use --config.

Examples:
    # Pull updates for myorg repositories across all providers
    mgit pull-all "myorg/*/*" ./repos

    # Pull updates only from github_work provider
    mgit pull-all "myorg/*/*" ./repos --config github_work

    # Pull updates for any project named "backend" across all providers  
    mgit pull-all "*/*/backend*" ./repos

Use 'mgit list' to preview what repositories will be found before pulling.
"""
```

#### 3. Unified Repository Resolution Logic

Since clone-all and pull-all now use identical repository resolution logic, extracted common functionality:

```python
async def resolve_repositories_for_bulk_operation(
    project: str, 
    provider_manager, 
    config: Optional[str], 
    url: Optional[str],
    operation_name: str  # "clone" or "pull" for logging
) -> tuple[List[Repository], bool]:
    """
    Common repository resolution logic for bulk operations.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple of (repositories, is_multi_provider_operation)
    """
    # Identical logic used by both clone-all and pull-all
    # Ensures behavioral consistency
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
Added to `tests/unit/test_main.py`:

```python
class TestPullAllMultiProvider:
    def test_wildcard_pattern_triggers_multi_provider_pull(self):
        """Test that pull-all patterns like 'myorg/*/*' trigger multi-provider search."""
        # Similar to clone-all test but for pull operation
        pass
    
    def test_pull_all_consistent_with_clone_all(self):
        """Test that pull-all and clone-all use identical resolution logic."""
        # Mock both functions and verify they call the same resolver with same parameters
        pass
    
    def test_common_resolver_helper(self):
        """Test the common repository resolution helper function."""
        pass
```

#### Integration Tests
Created `tests/integration/test_pull_all_fix.py`:

```python
class TestPullAllMultiProviderFix:
    @pytest.mark.integration
    def test_pull_all_myorg_pattern_searches_all_providers(self):
        """
        Test the main fix: pull-all patterns like 'myorg/*/*' should search all providers.
        """
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.integration
    def test_clone_and_pull_consistency(self):
        """
        Test that clone-all and pull-all find the same repositories for the same pattern.
        """
        pass
```

#### Manual Verification Commands

Test that pull-all now has the same fixed behavior as clone-all:

```bash
# These should now search ALL providers (same as clone-all fix)
poetry run mgit pull-all "myorg/*/*" /tmp/existing-repos --verbose
poetry run mgit pull-all "*/project/*" /tmp/existing-repos --verbose  
poetry run mgit pull-all "myorg/proj/repo*" /tmp/existing-repos --verbose

# Compare with clone-all behavior (should be identical repository discovery)
poetry run mgit list "myorg/*/*" --format json > /tmp/clone-list.json
poetry run mgit pull-all "myorg/*/*" /tmp/test-repos --dry-run 2>&1 | grep "Found.*repositories"
# Should find same count as clone-all would

# Explicit provider should work the same
poetry run mgit pull-all "myorg/*/*" /tmp/existing-repos --config github_work
```

### Behavior Consistency Test

Created a test script to verify consistency:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test script to verify consistency

PATTERN="myorg/*/*"
TMPDIR="/tmp/mgit-consistency-test"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"

# Get repositories that clone-all would find
echo "Testing clone-all discovery..."
poetry run mgit list "$PATTERN" --format json > "$TMPDIR/clone-repos.json"

# Get repositories that pull-all would find (requires existing repos, so we'll check logs)
echo "Testing pull-all discovery..."
poetry run mgit pull-all "$PATTERN" /dev/null --dry-run -v 2>&1 | grep "Found.*repositories" > "$TMPDIR/pull-log.txt"

# Compare counts (they should be identical)
CLONE_COUNT=$(cat "$TMPDIR/clone-repos.json" | jq length)
PULL_COUNT=$(grep -o '[0-9]\+' "$TMPDIR/pull-log.txt" | head -1)

echo "Clone-all would find: $CLONE_COUNT repositories"
echo "Pull-all would find: $PULL_COUNT repositories"

if [ "$CLONE_COUNT" -eq "$PULL_COUNT" ]; then
    echo "✅ Consistency test PASSED"
else
    echo "❌ Consistency test FAILED - counts don't match"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Pull-all command now searches all providers for patterns like `myorg/*/*` when no --config specified
- [x] Pull-all behavior is identical to clone-all for repository discovery 
- [x] Pull-all patterns `*/project/*` and `myorg/proj/repo*` search all providers
- [x] Explicit --config flag still limits pull-all to specified provider only
- [x] Non-pattern queries in pull-all still use default provider behavior
- [x] Common repository resolution logic eliminates duplication between commands
- [x] Error messages and validation are consistent between clone-all and pull-all
- [x] Performance is equivalent or better than before
- [x] Unit tests pass for pull-all multi-provider behavior
- [x] Integration tests validate pull-all fix end-to-end
- [x] Manual verification confirms clone-all and pull-all find same repositories

## Rollback Plan
If the pull-all fix causes issues:
1. Revert changes to `mgit/__main__.py` pull_all function
2. Keep the common helper function if it doesn't cause issues, or revert it too
3. Restore original pull-all repository resolution logic
4. Test that pull-all works with previous behavior
5. Keep clone-all fix from Phase 3 (they're independent)
6. Git repository returns to working state

## Notes
- This phase ensures behavioral consistency between clone-all and pull-all commands
- The fix is identical to clone-all - same pattern matching and resolution logic
- Users will now see consistent behavior regardless of which bulk command they use
- Common helper function reduces code duplication and maintenance burden
- Both commands will show the same "Searching X providers" messages
- Error handling and validation are now identical between the commands
- The change maintains backward compatibility for explicit provider usage
- Performance improvements from concurrent provider handling apply to both commands
