# Phase 1B: Fix Multi-Provider Pattern Matching - COMPLETED

## Completion Date: 2025-09-02
## Status: VERIFIED IN CODEBASE

## The Bug (FIXED)
Pattern `"PDI-Technologies/*/*"` only searched default provider, not all providers.

## Root Cause (ADDRESSED)
Code was checking if FIRST segment had wildcards. Now checks if ANY part has wildcards.

## Changes Verified

### Fix 1: `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/__main__.py` Lines 409, 411, 610, 612
```python
# CONFIRMED CHANGED FROM:
("*" in first_segment or "?" in first_segment)

# TO:
("*" in project or "?" in project)
```

### Fix 2: `/opt/aeo/mgit/mgit/commands/listing.py` Line 235
```python
# CONFIRMED CHANGED FROM:
("*" in first_segment or "?" in first_segment)

# TO:
("*" in query or "?" in query)
```

### Fix 3: Logger changes also implemented in error handling paths

## Test Results (All Passing)
The tests specified in the original spec all pass - multi-provider pattern matching now works correctly.

## Notes
This phase was already implemented in the codebase but the spec was still in the pending folder. Now properly moved to done with verification.
