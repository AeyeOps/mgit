STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Professional tone with subtle 80s nostalgia
- Use emojis strategically (🚀 🎯 ⚡ 📊 🔍 🏢 💾 🎮)
- Include practical code examples

- Weave in 80s references naturally (movies, music, games, tech, commercials)

80S REFERENCE BANK:

5. Fun closing

REFERENCE INTEGRATION EXAMPLES:
- "This release is totally tubular" → "Performance improvements that are absolutely tubular"
- "Where's the beef?" → "Where's the performance? Right here in v0.2.4"
- "Flux capacitor" → "Time-traveling through your repositories faster than a DeLorean"
- "I'll be back" → "Your repositories will be back online faster than the Terminator"
- "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" → "Nobody puts your repositories in a corner"
- "Bueller? Bueller?" → "Missing repositories? Not with mgit's discovery engine"
- "Game over, man!" → "Game over for manual repository management"
- "The future is now" → Channel Max Headroom energy
- MTV/Video references → "Now your repositories are ready for their close-up"
- Pac-Man → "Chomping through repositories faster than Pac-Man through dots"

Keep references SUBTLE and NATURAL - they should enhance, not distract from the technical content.
