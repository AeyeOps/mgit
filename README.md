# Azure DevOps CLI Tool

## Overview

This command-line interface (CLI) tool is designed to interact with Azure DevOps services. It facilitates operations such as logging in to Azure DevOps, cloning all repositories from a project, pulling updates for all repositories, and generating environment configuration files. The tool is built using Python and leverages several libraries including `typer` for CLI command handling, `asyncio` for asynchronous operations, and `subprocess` for executing shell commands.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several key components:

1. **Environment and Configuration Management**
2. **Logging Setup**
3. **Azure DevOps Manager**
4. **Git Manager**
5. **CLI Commands**

Each of these components plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the CLI tool.

## Environment and Configuration Management

The code begins by loading environment variables using the `dotenv` library. These variables include essential configuration details such as the Azure DevOps organization URL and personal access token (PAT). Default values are provided for these variables, ensuring that the tool can function even if some environment variables are not explicitly set.

```python
DEFAULT_VALUES = {
    "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL": "https://www.visualstudio.com",
    "AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT": "<your-pat-token>",
    "LOG_FILENAME": "ado-cli.log",
    "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG",
    "CON_LEVEL": "INFO",
}

load_dotenv(
    dotenv_path=None,
    verbose=True,
    override=True,
)
```

## Logging Setup

Logging is a critical aspect of this CLI tool, providing insights into its operations and aiding in debugging. The code uses Python's `logging` module, enhanced with `RichHandler` from the `rich` library for better console output. A custom formatter, `AdoCliFormatter`, is implemented to sanitize logs by removing sensitive information such as PATs from URLs.

```python
class AdoCliFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    """Formatter that removes PAT from the URL in logs."""
    ...
```

The logging setup includes both file and console handlers, with configurable log levels.

## Azure DevOps Manager

The `AzDevOpsManager` class encapsulates functionality related to Azure DevOps operations. It includes methods to check if the Azure CLI and its DevOps extension are installed, log into Azure DevOps using a PAT, and configure default settings for the organization and project.

```python
class AzDevOpsManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ado_org = os.getenv(
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL",
            DEFAULT_VALUES["AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL"],
        )
        self.ado_pat = os.getenv(
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT",
            DEFAULT_VALUES["AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT"],
        )
    ...
```

### Key Methods

- **check_az_cli_installed**: Verifies the installation of the Azure CLI.
- **ensure_ado_ext_installed**: Ensures the Azure DevOps extension is installed.
- **is_logged_into_az_devops**: Checks if the user is logged into Azure DevOps.
- **login_to_az_devops**: Logs into Azure DevOps using the provided PAT.
- **configure_az_devops**: Configures default organization and project settings.

## Git Manager

The `GitManager` class handles Git operations such as cloning and pulling repositories. It uses asynchronous methods to perform these operations, allowing for concurrent execution and improved performance.

```python
class GitManager:
    GIT_EXECUTABLE = "git"

    async def git_clone(
        self, repo_url: str, output_dir: Path
    ):
        ...
```

### Key Methods

- **git_clone**: Clones a repository into a specified directory.
- **git_pull**: Pulls the latest changes for an existing repository.
- **_run_subprocess**: A helper method to execute shell commands asynchronously.

## CLI Commands

The CLI tool is built using `typer`, which simplifies the creation of command-line interfaces. The tool provides several commands, each corresponding to a specific operation.

### login Command

This command allows users to authenticate with Azure DevOps using a Personal Access Token (PAT). It provides interactive prompts if credentials are not provided, and can store them securely for future use.

```bash
# Login with prompts for organization URL and PAT
python ado-cli.py login

# Login with explicitly provided credentials
python ado-cli.py login --org https://dev.azure.com/your-org --pat your-pat-token

# Login without storing credentials
python ado-cli.py login --no-store
```

### clone_all Command

This command clones all repositories from a specified Azure DevOps project into a local directory. It supports various update modes, allowing users to skip, pull, or force clone repositories.

```bash
# Clone all repos from a project
python ado-cli.py clone-all project-name ./repos

# Clone with 8 concurrent operations and force mode (overwrite existing repos)
python ado-cli.py clone-all project-name ./repos -c 8 -u force
```

### pull_all Command

The `pull_all` command updates all repositories in a specified directory by pulling the latest changes from Azure DevOps.

```bash
# Pull latest changes for all repos
python ado-cli.py pull-all project-name ./repos
```

### gen_env Command

This command generates an environment file with the necessary configuration variables, using existing values if available.

```bash
# Generate environment file
python ado-cli.py gen-env
```

    K1 --> N1[End]
    M1 --> N2[End]
    M2 --> N3[End]
    I --> N4[End]
```

## Authentication

The tool supports multiple authentication methods for Azure DevOps:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL` and `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` in your environment
2. **Login Command**: Use the interactive `login` command to authenticate and optionally store credentials
3. **Dotenv File**: Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your credentials

The login process is resilient, with multiple fallback mechanisms:
- Environment variable-based authentication (most reliable)
- Explicit credential storage using Azure CLI
- Basic auth via request headers

## Security

The tool takes security seriously:
- PATs are never exposed in logs or console output
- Credential files have restricted permissions (0600)
- Support for multiple authentication methods to suit different security requirements
- Self-cleanup of sensitive information in memory

## Conclusion

The Azure DevOps CLI tool is a well-structured application that leverages modern Python libraries to provide a robust interface for managing Azure DevOps repositories. It efficiently handles authentication, environment configuration, logging, and asynchronous operations, making it a valuable tool for developers and DevOps engineers. The use of `typer` for command handling and `asyncio` for concurrent operations demonstrates a modern approach to building CLI applications in Python.

Define a JSON structure for configuration files, allowing users to specify multiple profiles.

```json
{
    "profiles": {
        "default": {
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL": "https://dev.azure.com/your-org",
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT": "your-pat-token"
        },
        "profile1": {
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL": "https://dev.azure.com/another-org",
            "AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT": "another-pat-token"
        }
    }
}
```

### Configuration Management Class

Implement a class to handle loading and managing configuration profiles.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

class ConfigManager:
    CONFIG_FILE = Path.home() / ".ado_cli_config.json"

    def __init__(self):
        self.config = self.load_config()

    def load_config(self):
        if self.CONFIG_FILE.exists():
            with open(self.CONFIG_FILE, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                return json.load(f)
        else:
            return {"profiles": {}}

    def save_config(self):
        with open(self.CONFIG_FILE, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            json.dump(self.config, f, indent=4)

    def get_profile(self, profile_name="default"):
        return self.config["profiles"].get(profile_name, {})

    def set_profile(self, profile_name, settings):
        self.config["profiles"][profile_name] = settings
        self.save_config()

    def list_profiles(self):
        return list(self.config["profiles"].keys())
```

### CLI Commands for Profile Management

Add commands to manage configuration profiles.

```python
@app.command(help="List available configuration profiles.")
def list_profiles():
    config_manager = ConfigManager()
    profiles = config_manager.list_profiles()
    console.print("Available profiles:")
    for profile in profiles:
        console.print(f" - {profile}")

@app.command(help="Set a configuration profile.")
def set_profile(
    profile_name: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Profile name."),
    org_url: str = typer.Option(..., help="Azure DevOps organization URL."),
    pat: str = typer.Option(..., help="Personal Access Token.")
):
    config_manager = ConfigManager()
    config_manager.set_profile(profile_name, {
        "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL": org_url,
        "AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT": pat
    })
    console.print(f"Profile '{profile_name}' set successfully.")

@app.command(help="Use a configuration profile.")
def use_profile(
    profile_name: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Profile name.")
):
    config_manager = ConfigManager()
    profile = config_manager.get_profile(profile_name)
    if not profile:
        console.print(f"Profile '{profile_name}' not found.")
        raise typer.Exit(code=1)

    os.environ["AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL"] = profile["AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL"]
    os.environ["AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT"] = profile["AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT"]
    console.print(f"Profile '{profile_name}' is now active.")
```

Users can easily manage multiple configurations, reducing the complexity of switching between different environments or projects. This improvement enhances the tool's usability and adaptability, making it more suitable for diverse use cases.
# Improvement Addendum 3: Improved Asynchronous Operations

## Overview

The Azure DevOps CLI tool currently uses `asyncio` for asynchronous operations, which allows for concurrent execution of tasks such as cloning and pulling repositories. However, there is room for optimization in task scheduling and execution to further improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of repositories.

## Design and Architecture

### Objectives

1. **Optimized Task Scheduling:** Implement a more efficient task scheduling mechanism to manage concurrent operations.
2. **Resource Management:** Ensure optimal use of system resources to prevent bottlenecks and improve throughput.
3. **Scalability:** Enhance the tool's ability to handle a large number of repositories efficiently.

### Approach

- **Task Queue:** Use a task queue to manage and schedule tasks, allowing for better control over concurrency levels.
- **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits to prevent overloading the system, such as limiting the number of concurrent network connections.
- **Error Handling:** Integrate improved error handling within asynchronous operations to manage failures gracefully.

## Code Changes

### Task Queue Implementation

Implement a task queue to manage asynchronous operations.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Queue

class AsyncTaskManager:
    def __init__(self, concurrency_limit):
        self.concurrency_limit = concurrency_limit
        self.queue = Queue()
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency_limit)

    async def worker(self):
        while True:
            task = await self.queue.get()
            try:
                await task()
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Task failed with error: {e}")
            finally:
                self.queue.task_done()

    async def add_task(self, task):
        await self.queue.put(task)

    async def run(self):
        workers = [asyncio.create_task(self.worker()) for _ in range(self.concurrency_limit)]
        await self.queue.join()
        for worker in workers:
            worker.cancel()
```

### Integration with Git Operations

Integrate the task queue with Git operations to manage cloning and pulling tasks.

```python
async def clone_repo(git_manager, repo_url, output_dir):
    try:
        await git_manager.git_clone(repo_url, output_dir)
    except GitCloneError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to clone {repo_url}: {e}")

async def pull_repo(git_manager, repo_dir):
    try:
        await git_manager.git_pull(repo_dir)
    except GitPullError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to pull {repo_dir}: {e}")

async def process_repositories(git_manager, repos, output_dir, concurrency_limit):
    task_manager = AsyncTaskManager(concurrency_limit)
    for repo in repos:
        repo_url = repo["Url"]
        repo_name = repo["Name"]
        repo_dir = output_dir / repo_name
        if not repo_dir.exists():
            await task_manager.add_task(lambda: clone_repo(git_manager, repo_url, output_dir))
        else:
            await task_manager.add_task(lambda: pull_repo(git_manager, repo_dir))
    await task_manager.run()
```

### Improved Asynchronous Operations Flow Diagram

The following mermaid diagram illustrates the improved asynchronous operations flow:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Task Manager]
    B --> C[Add Tasks to Queue]
    C --> D[Run Task Manager]
    D --> E{Task Available?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Acquire Semaphore]
    F --> G[Execute Task]
    G --> H[Release Semaphore]
    H --> E
    E -->|No| I[All Tasks Completed]
    I --> J[End]
```

## Conclusion

By implementing a task queue and optimizing asynchronous operations, the Azure DevOps CLI tool can handle a larger number of repositories more efficiently. This improvement enhances the tool's scalability and performance, ensuring that it can manage concurrent operations without overwhelming system resources. The integration of improved error handling within asynchronous tasks also contributes to a more robust and resilient application.

from rich.progress import Progress, BarColumn, TextColumn

def display_progress(task_name, total):
    progress = Progress(
        TextColumn("[progress.description]{task.description}"),
        BarColumn(),
        "[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}%",
    )
    task_id = progress.add_task(task_name, total=total)
    return progress, task_id

async def process_repositories_with_progress(git_manager, repos, output_dir, concurrency_limit):
    task_manager = AsyncTaskManager(concurrency_limit)
    progress, task_id = display_progress("Processing Repositories", len(repos))
    with progress:
        for repo in repos:
            repo_url = repo["Url"]
            repo_name = repo["Name"]
            repo_dir = output_dir / repo_name
            if not repo_dir.exists():
                await task_manager.add_task(lambda: clone_repo(git_manager, repo_url, output_dir))
            else:
                await task_manager.add_task(lambda: pull_repo(git_manager, repo_dir))
            progress.advance(task_id)
        await task_manager.run()
```

### Interactive Prompts

Implement interactive confirmation prompts for critical operations.

```python
@app.command(help="Remove a repository folder.")
def remove_repo(
    repo_name: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Repository name."),
    confirm: bool = typer.Option(False, "--confirm", "-c", help="Confirm removal without prompt.")
):
    repo_dir = Path.cwd() / repo_name
    if not repo_dir.exists():
        console.print(f"Repository '{repo_name}' does not exist.")
        raise typer.Exit(code=1)

    if not confirm:
        confirm = typer.confirm(f"Are you sure you want to remove the repository '{repo_name}'?")
    if confirm:
        shutil.rmtree(repo_dir)
        console.print(f"Repository '{repo_name}' removed successfully.")
    else:
        console.print("Operation cancelled.")
```

### Organized Help Messages

Enhance help messages with clear descriptions and examples.

```python
@app.command(help="Clone all repositories from Azure DevOps project.")
def clone_all(
    project: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Azure DevOps project name."),
    rel_path: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Relative path to clone into."),
    ...
):
    """
    Clone all repositories from the specified Azure DevOps project into the given relative path.

    Example:
        $ ado-cli clone-all my-project ./repos

    This command will clone all repositories from 'my-project' into the './repos' directory.
    """
    ...
```

## Conclusion

By implementing user interface enhancements, the Azure DevOps CLI tool becomes more intuitive and user-friendly. Detailed progress indicators keep users informed about ongoing operations, while interactive prompts ensure that critical actions are confirmed before execution. Improved help messages provide clear guidance on command usage, reducing the learning curve for new users and enhancing the overall user experience.
# Improvement Addendum 5: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Overview

The Azure DevOps CLI tool would benefit from a comprehensive testing suite that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This ensures that all components of the tool function correctly and that new features or changes do not introduce regressions.

## Design and Architecture

### Objectives

1. **Unit Testing:** Implement unit tests for individual functions and classes to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing:** Develop integration tests to verify that different components of the tool work together correctly.
3. **End-to-End Testing:** Create end-to-end tests to simulate real-world usage scenarios and validate the tool's overall functionality.

### Approach

- **Testing Framework:** Use a testing framework like `pytest` for writing and executing tests.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Utilize mocking and stubbing to isolate tests and simulate external dependencies such as Azure DevOps services.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate tests into a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality.

## Code Changes

### Unit Testing

Implement unit tests for core functions using `pytest`.

```python
import pytest
from ado_cli import AzDevOpsManager, GitManager

def test_az_cli_installed(mocker):
    mocker.patch('subprocess.run', return_value=mocker.Mock(returncode=0))
    manager = AzDevOpsManager()
    assert manager.check_az_cli_installed() is None

def test_git_clone(mocker):
    mocker.patch('asyncio.create_subprocess_exec', return_value=mocker.Mock(returncode=0))
    git_manager = GitManager()
    assert asyncio.run(git_manager.git_clone("https://repo.url", Path("/output/dir"))) is None
```

### Integration Testing

Develop integration tests to verify interactions between components.

```python
def test_clone_all_integration(mocker):
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.AzDevOpsManager.check_az_cli_installed', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.AzDevOpsManager.login_to_az_devops', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.GitManager.git_clone', return_value=None)

    # Simulate CLI command execution
    result = runner.invoke(app, ['clone-all', 'my-project', './repos'])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Cloning all repositories" in result.output
```

### End-to-End Testing

Create end-to-end tests to simulate real-world scenarios.

```python
def test_end_to_end_clone(mocker):
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.AzDevOpsManager.check_az_cli_installed', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.AzDevOpsManager.login_to_az_devops', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch('ado_cli.GitManager.git_clone', return_value=None)

    # Simulate full workflow
    result = runner.invoke(app, ['clone-all', 'my-project', './repos'])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "All repositories processed successfully" in result.output
```

### Comprehensive Testing Suite Flow Diagram

The following mermaid diagram illustrates the comprehensive testing suite flow:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Unit Testing]
    B --> C[Integration Testing]
    C --> D[End-to-End Testing]
    D --> E[Mocking and Stubbing]
    E --> F[Continuous Integration]
    F --> G[Execute Tests]
    G --> H{All Tests Pass?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Deploy Code]
    H -->|No| J[Fix Issues]
    J --> G
    I --> K[End]
```

## Conclusion

By implementing a comprehensive testing suite, the Azure DevOps CLI tool ensures high code quality and reliability. Unit tests verify individual components, integration tests check component interactions, and end-to-end tests validate real-world scenarios. This improvement facilitates continuous integration and deployment processes, providing confidence that the tool will perform as expected in various environments.
