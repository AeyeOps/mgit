## Environment-Specific Checklists

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Pre-deployment
□ Run deployment script in dry-run mode
□ Verify staging environment resources
□ Check configuration differences

# Deployment
□ Execute: ./scripts/deploy.sh --environment staging --version X.Y.Z
□ Monitor deployment logs
□ Verify health checks

# Validation
□ Run smoke tests
□ Check monitoring dashboards
□ Verify integrations
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Pre-deployment
□ Complete staging validation
□ Schedule maintenance window
□ Notify stakeholders

# Deployment
□ Execute: ./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production --version X.Y.Z
□ Monitor closely for 30 minutes
□ Verify business metrics

# Post-deployment
□ Update status page
□ Monitor for 24 hours
□ Collect feedback
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health checks failing for > 5 minutes
- Error rate exceeding 5% for > 2 minutes
- Response time > 10x baseline for > 1 minute

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Immediate rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --force

# Verify rollback
kubectl get pods -n mgit-production
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --environment production
```
