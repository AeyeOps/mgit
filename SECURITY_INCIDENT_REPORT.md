# Security Incident Report - Exposed Azure DevOps PAT

## Executive Summary
A potentially real Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT) was discovered in the `/opt/aeo/mgit/.env` file. Immediate action was taken to remove the token and secure the environment.

## Incident Details

### Discovery
- **Date**: 2025-01-29
- **Location**: `/opt/aeo/mgit/.env`
- **Type**: Exposed credential (Azure DevOps PAT)
- **Token Pattern**: `9k57dCA78gti6wXOVNob80h3KpexwO83bW4Q7Cf8gI7t1VHX69oJJQQJ99BCACAAAAAvnKpCAAASAZDO3Njs`
- **Organization URL**: `https://pdidev.visualstudio.com`

### Risk Assessment
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to Azure DevOps repositories and resources
- **Exposure**: Limited - file was never committed to git history

## Actions Taken

### Immediate Response
1. ✅ **Token Removed**: The exposed PAT was immediately replaced with placeholder text `YOUR_PAT_TOKEN_HERE`
2. ✅ **Git History Checked**: Confirmed `.env` was never committed to git repository
3. ✅ **Gitignore Verified**: Confirmed `.env` is properly listed in `.gitignore` (line 137)
4. ✅ **Sample File Verified**: `.env.sample` exists with proper placeholder values

### Security Status
- **Git History**: CLEAN - No trace of the token in git history
- **Current State**: SECURED - Token removed from `.env` file
- **Prevention**: ACTIVE - `.env` is gitignored and will not be committed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **REVOKE THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY**
   - The exposed token must be revoked in Azure DevOps
   - Organization: `https://pdidev.visualstudio.com`
   - Generate a new PAT with appropriate permissions

2. **Audit Access Logs**
   - Check Azure DevOps audit logs for any unauthorized access
   - Review recent repository activities

3. **Update Local Configuration**
   - Generate new PAT
   - Update `.env` file with new token
   - Ensure new token has minimal required permissions

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Consider Secure Credential Storage**
   - Use system keyring/credential manager
   - Implement encrypted credential storage
   - Consider OAuth flow instead of PATs

2. **Add Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Install tools like `detect-secrets` or `gitleaks`
   - Prevent accidental credential commits

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Emphasize security best practices in README
   - Add warnings about credential handling
   - Include setup instructions that highlight security

## Technical Details

### File Permissions Check
```bash
# Recommended: Restrict .env file permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

### Git Configuration
- `.gitignore` properly configured (line 137: `.env`)
- `.env.sample` is tracked and contains safe placeholder values

## Incident Timeline
- Initial discovery of exposed token in `.env`
- Verification that token was never committed to git
- Immediate token removal and replacement with placeholder
- Creation of this security incident report

## Conclusion
While the token was exposed in a local file, it was never committed to the git repository, limiting the exposure. However, the token should still be considered compromised and must be revoked immediately. The local environment has been secured, but follow-up actions are critical to ensure complete remediation.

**Status**: Immediate threat mitigated, awaiting token revocation
