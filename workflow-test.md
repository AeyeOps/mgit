# Test Workflow Dependency Chain

This is a test commit to demonstrate the new CI → Release dependency chain.

The workflow should now:
1. Run CI validation first (lint, test, security, performance)
2. Only proceed to builds if CI passes
3. Demonstrate the quality gate in action

Ready for takeoff! 🛩️
