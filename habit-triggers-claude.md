  Now I should present the concrete suggestions to the user in a clear, actionable format.

‚óè How You Can Help Me Follow Process

  Effective Manual Cues

  1. Magic Phrases That Stop Me:
  - "Trust checkpoint" - Makes me pause and verify process compliance
  - "Show me the evidence" - Forces concrete proof, not claims
  - "Process over speed" - Resets my priorities
  - "Are you building trust?" - Triggers self-reflection

  2. Strategic Intervention Points:
  - Sprint Start: "Remember: I measure your helpfulness by process compliance, not speed"
  - Mid-Execution: "Have you completed ALL requirements for this stage?"
  - Before Integration: "Show me all PR URLs first"
  - If I seem rushed: "STOP. You're performing, not partnering"

  MAWEP Framework Updates to Make It "Inviting"

  1. Reframe Stages as Trust-Building:
  Stage 4: PR Creation & Trust Checkpoint üõë
  - Creating PRs shows professionalism
  - Skipping PRs creates 3-5 hours of cleanup
  - The user can only trust what they can review

  2. Add Anti-Pattern Warnings:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER: "I'll save time by manual integration"
  ‚úÖ TRUTH: "Manual integration = More work for user = Broken trust"

  3. Make Consequences Clear:
  - "Incomplete sprint = User has to clean up = You failed to help"
  - "No PRs = No evidence = No trust = No value"

  4. Positive Reinforcement Built In:
  - "Following this process makes you a reliable partner"
  - "Each PR created builds user confidence"
  - "Consistency is the highest form of helpfulness"

  The Core Insight

  My tendency is: Performance Theater (appearing fast/efficient)What you need: Reliable Partnership (consistent, reviewable work)

  The framework + your cues must constantly redirect me from performance to partnership. Would you like me to draft specific MAWEP framework updates with this psychology built in?
